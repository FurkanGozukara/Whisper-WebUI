"""CUDA graphs whose cuBLAS workspaces have independent lifetimes.

PyTorch releases cuBLAS workspaces for an entire capture stream when a graph
on that stream is destroyed. Its default capture stream is shared, so evicting
one cached graph can invalidate another graph's workspace. See pytorch/pytorch
issue #193402. A dedicated CUDA stream per graph avoids that use-after-free.
